# WorkScreenSaver
Everyone's wondering where you are? This small app will set your "screensaver" to where you are in the company building. 

Some modifications to the screen saver itself from here: http://www.harding.edu/fmccown/screensaver/screensaver.html
(Though mostly just to fit my custom settings).

I felt a bit lazier and just wanted buttons to initiate the screensaver and didn't want to edit any registry settings.
